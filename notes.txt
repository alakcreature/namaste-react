Here React.createElement() is just a object which will be turned to html tag by the render method by creating a tree in the dom.
ReactElement(Object) => HTML(Browser Understands)
Whenever we pass root.render, the contents in div.#root will be replaced by that.
We can use react in uor existing project because it wil only affect only the root html tag. That's why its a library not a framework.

Bundler: It packages our app properly so that it could be shipped to production such as webpack, parcel or vite.

dependencies & dev-dependencies

package-lock.json: It keeps the track of all the versions of all dependencies.

To install a package we use 'npm' and to use any package we use 'npx'.

- if we want to remove console.log(*) calls from our production build files, use babel-plugin-transform-remove-console package


- JSX: React came up with a philosophy that we have to update html using javascript. It is HTML like syntax but not HTML syntax.
